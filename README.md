#  Personal Progress Tracker

**Personal Progress Tracker** is a flexible and reusable web-based application that helps you monitor your progress on various tasks. Whether you're tracking learning goals, fitness routines, or daily habits, the tracker provides visual insights to keep you motivated.

## 📝 How it Works

1. **Track Tasks:** Mark tasks as completed for both morning and afternoon sessions.
2. **Visualize Progress:** View a summary of your performance through Pie and Bar charts.
3. **Daily Insights:** See what you've accomplished each day in the "What I Learned" section.
4. **Reusable Setup:** Easily customize the tasks by editing `utils/Task.js` to match your own goals.
